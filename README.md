# 🧮 Model Evaluation Metrics in Python

This project provides a simple yet powerful Python script to compute key evaluation metrics for binary classification models.
It calculates:
- ✅ Accuracy
- 📏 Precision
- 🎯 Sensitivity (Recall / True Positive Rate)
- 🛡️ Specificity (True Negative Rate)
- 🧠 F1 Score
- 🧾 Confusion Matrix

Ideal for beginners, educators, and interview scenarios where easy analysis of sensitivity and specificity calculation is required.
